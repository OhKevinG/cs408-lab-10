## Overview

This project implements a very simple game similar to the game "slither". Source HTML, CSS and JavaScript were provided before hand and I added some tweaks to each program in order to add a user controlled object that could "eat" other objects on the screen. EvilCircle is a new class added that extends Shape, another new class that is used as an example for inheritance. The Ball class is updated to be a subclass of Shape. A counter was added to the top of the screen to keep track of the number of ball objects still in play.

## Running

Recommended to just open repository in VSCode and use the live preview feature, then copy the url into preferred browser.

## Reflection

I did not have too much trouble with the assignment if only because the instructions were very clear and helpful. I either referenced the mozilla web development site we've been reading or used the developer tools to help me figure out what to do. Specifically when I got stuck I used the developer tools to find out it was just a simple syntax or minor error and was an easy fix. All in all I did not have too much trouble with the specific requirements, but the program could definitely be improved.
